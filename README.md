# Starship-EVO-Backers-Ships
Repo centralizing backers reward.

Please do a post per reward type. Higher reward will make several post as it cumulate all lower rewards.
Write title as below:

Title:
[Backers Tier - Ship reward] Name of the ship
for example
[Corporate Mogul - Corporation Ships] ABC Corp Big Ship - ABC Corp Medium Ship - ABC Corp Small Ship

In the post please write:

1) TIER: your reward tier
2) CODE: the steam key code used - I will use this to identify you and your reward.
3) NAME: the name of your ship
4) a screenshot
5) and the blueprint of course.

Dont put any tags, me and the mod will deal with that.

You can book a post with WIP screenshots, we are curious to see what you are building!

A few rules apply:
=> Size: shuttle can be 30m instead of 20m. This must be the full size with landing gear deployed.
=> civilian ship have no weapons.
=> No trolling, no offensive content, no licensed ship for other IP, no zero effort submission
=> No overuse of children entity or weapon spam. The ship must run smoothly.
=> Ship must be heat/power balanced, and the balanced not too tight (decent Power and Heat delta, ie under 75% used / available)
=> Of course it must be flying

If you have a question you can book a case I will answer!
If you are doing something funky and not sure if it will works you can also ask. Better to ask before than once the ship is completed!

Happy building!
